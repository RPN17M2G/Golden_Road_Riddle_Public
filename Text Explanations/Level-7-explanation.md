The stakes of the survivability of operational tools are:

1. Enemy fire – physical tools are always under the risk of being bombed, so they must has an armor to guard them and keep the internal parts hidden.
1. Enemy’s cyber abilities – most of the tools this days use software as well as hardware. If the enemy can hack the software, the tools might be unusable at best and dangerous to our forces at worst.
1. Human fault – A mistake that our forces make that causes injuries, death or a problem in the tool. Some examples are: Not taking care on the tool correctly(oiling\ In software – undated software with vulnerabilities). Using the tool incorrectly(pushing wrong buttons, starting processes without aa needed preparation(for example trying to shoot when the barrel is blocked).
1. Build quality – A poor build quality(of hardware and software) can cause the tool to be destroyed. For example a wrong code can crush the tool or change memory locations that shouldn’t be touched and be dangerous for the tool as much as a loose screw.

The technologies that can help improve the survivability of an operational tool are:

1. QA – quality assurance. QA can help detect faults in the tool before it is deployed to the missions. It can prevent dangerous faults and help improve the quality of the software\hardware
1. Program that monitors the memory and resources constantly – A program like this can prevent real time faults and potentially save many tools and soldiers. The program will monitor the memory that the software writes to and reads from while blocking the unwanted memory writes and reads. The program will also keep the temperatures and the resources under control and prevent crashes.
1. Improve soldier’s education – Test the soldiers in an “unexpected” like reality event(for example an attack in the middle of the night using a different unit of our soldiers and with fake weapons). And improve the understanding of the soldiers on the tools – how to use the tool, how to take care of the tool. Also let them train on a real tool. I know that it is already done but in my opinion as much training as possible is the better.
